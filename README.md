# 🔀 Multiple Zigbee2MQTT

Home Assistant *does* allow you to run multiple Zigbee2MQTT add-ons — but setting this up can be a bit hacky 🤕
On top of that, all instances end up with the same name, which gets confusing *fast*.

This add-on exists for one simple reason: **to make that experience smoother** ✨

This repository acts as a **small configuration wrapper** around
`hassio-zigbee2mqtt/zigbee2mqtt`.

It **only changes the add-on name**. 🚫 No behavior is modified. ✅ Zigbee2MQTT works exactly the same.

## 🖥️ One frontend for all instances

With the introduction of the new Zigbee2MQTT frontend **WindFront**, a standalone frontend add-on is available from its designer [**Nerivec**](https://github.com/Nerivec).

This allows you to manage **all Zigbee2MQTT instances from a single UI** 🎉

### 🔓 Open frontend ports

To use WindFront, each Zigbee2MQTT instance needs a frontend port.

* Open the *configuration page* of your Zigbee2MQTT instance
* Scroll to *Network*
* Enable *Show disabled ports*

![Add-on store example](images/disabled_ports.png)

* Configure a **Frontend TCP listen port**, for example: \
 `8091` or `8092` or `8093`

Repeat this for **each instance**.

### 📦 Install WindFront

* Go to *Settings → Apps*

* Click *Install app*

* Open the *three-dot menu* → *Repositories*

### ⚙️ Configure WindFront
